# Student Data Processing

This project utilizes the `Student` class from Lesson 60 (see `Student.java`).

## Usage

1. Create a list of students with their respective scores.
2. Prompt the user to enter the minimum passing score.
3. Display the list of students based on the following criteria:
   - Each student is displayed on a separate line.
   - The sum of scores for each student is above the minimum passing score.
   - Students are sorted in descending order of their average scores.
   - The list contains no more than 10 students (apologies, it's a competition).

## Implementation

The processing and output of the result are done using streams (Stream).
